# Thoughts junkyard
## Description
Thoughts junkyard is a small pet-project developed by me (the only member of this organization ðŸ™‚) in training and learning purposes.<br />
It allows user to create account and perform CRUD on posts.

## Architecture
It consists of 5 parts that are meant to be housed in their own docker container:
- **MySQL** â€“ stores data
- **User service** - works with users and sessions
- **Redis** â€“ caches tokens for user service + stores info for sidekiq jobs  
- **Post service** - works with posts
- **Frontend** - serves data to the end-user

You can see the diagram representing this architecure below.<br />

## How to connect
Unfortunately free PaaS services don't allow to deploy all this magnificence and VPS aren't free<br />
But you still can check it out with private tunneling <br />
All containers are hosted localy on my machine which is online most of the time so using radmin vpn should be enough<br />
(You can see up-to-date tunnel connection data in the place you found this repo)

## How to deploy
1. Install MySQL container from official image. (Tested on mysql:8.4.3)
  - Create db called tj_production
  - Create 2 users with all permissions on this db (one for each of services)<br />
Default user names services will look for are user_service and post_service but you are free to choose new ones
2. Install redis container from official image. (Tested on redis:7.4.1)
3. Install user_service container via evilphilin/tj_user_service
4. Install post_service container via evilphilin/tj_post_service
5. Install frontend part of app via evilphilin/tj_frontend
